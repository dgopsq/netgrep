                      THE ADVENTURE OF THE DYING DETECTIVE

                               Arthur Conan Doyle



     Mrs. Hudson, the landlady of Sherlock Holmes, was a long-suffering
     woman. Not only was her first-floor flat invaded at all hours by
     throngs of singular and often undesirable characters but her
     remarkable lodger showed an eccentricity and irregularity in his life
     which must have sorely tried her patience. His incredible untidiness,
     his addiction to music at strange hours, his occasional revolver
     practice within doors, his weird and often malodorous scientific
     experiments, and the atmosphere of violence and danger which hung
     around him made him the very worst tenant in London. On the other
     hand, his payments were princely. I have no doubt that the house
     might have been purchased at the price which Holmes paid for his
     rooms during the years that I was with him.

     The landlady stood in the deepest awe of him and never dared to
     interfere with him, however outrageous his proceedings might seem.
     She was fond of him, too, for he had a remarkable gentleness and
     courtesy in his dealings with women. He disliked and distrusted the
     sex, but he was always a chivalrous opponent. Knowing how genuine was
     her regard for him, I listened earnestly to her story when she came
     to my rooms in the second year of my married life and told me of the
     sad condition to which my poor friend was reduced.

     "He's dying, Dr. Watson," said she. "For three days he has been
     sinking, and I doubt if he will last the day. He would not let me get
     a doctor. This morning when I saw his bones sticking out of his face
     and his great bright eyes looking at me I could stand no more of it.
     'With your leave or without it, Mr. Holmes, I am going for a doctor
     this very hour,' said I. 'Let it be Watson, then,' said he. I
     wouldn't waste an hour in coming to him, sir, or you may not see him
     alive."

     I was horrified for I had heard nothing of his illness. I need not
     say that I rushed for my coat and my hat. As we drove back I asked
     for the details.

     "There is little I can tell you, sir. He has been working at a case
     down at Rotherhithe, in an alley near the river, and he has brought
     this illness back with him. He took to his bed on Wednesday afternoon
     and has never moved since. For these three days neither food nor
     drink has passed his lips."

     "Good God! Why did you not call in a doctor?"

     "He wouldn't have it, sir. You know how masterful he is. I didn't
     dare to disobey him. But he's not long for this world, as you'll see
     for yourself the moment that you set eyes on him."

     He was indeed a deplorable spectacle. In the dim light of a foggy
     November day the sick room was a gloomy spot, but it was that gaunt,
     wasted face staring at me from the bed which sent a chill to my
     heart. His eyes had the brightness of fever, there was a hectic flush
     upon either cheek, and dark crusts clung to his lips; the thin hands
     upon the coverlet twitched incessantly, his voice was croaking and
     spasmodic. He lay listlessly as I entered the room, but the sight of
     me brought a gleam of recognition to his eyes.

     "Well, Watson, we seem to have fallen upon evil days," said he in a
     feeble voice, but with something of his old carelessness of manner.

     "My dear fellow!" I cried, approaching him.

     "Stand back! Stand right back!" said he with the sharp imperiousness
     which I had associated only with moments of crisis. "If you approach
     me, Watson, I shall order you out of the house."

     "But why?"

     "Because it is my desire. Is that not enough?"

     Yes, Mrs. Hudson was right. He was more masterful than ever. It was
     pitiful, however, to see his exhaustion.

     "I only wished to help," I explained.

     "Exactly! You will help best by doing what you are told."

     "Certainly, Holmes."

     He relaxed the austerity of his manner.

     "You are not angry?" he asked, gasping for breath.

     Poor devil, how could I be angry when I saw him lying in such a
     plight before me?

     "It's for your own sake, Watson," he croaked.

     "For my sake?"

     "I know what is the matter with me. It is a coolie disease from
     Sumatra--a thing that the Dutch know more about than we, though they
     have made little of it up to date. One thing only is certain. It is
     infallibly deadly, and it is horribly contagious."

     He spoke now with a feverish energy, the long hands twitching and
     jerking as he motioned me away.

     "Contagious by touch, Watson--that's it, by touch. Keep your distance
     and all is well."

     "Good heavens, Holmes! Do you suppose that such a consideration
     weighs with me of an instant? It would not affect me in the case of a
     stranger. Do you imagine it would prevent me from doing my duty to so
     old a friend?"

     Again I advanced, but he repulsed me with a look of furious anger.

     "If you will stand there I will talk. If you do not you must leave
     the room."

     I have so deep a respect for the extraordinary qualities of Holmes
     that I have always deferred to his wishes, even when I least
     understood them. But now all my professional instincts were aroused.
     Let him be my master elsewhere, I at least was his in a sick room.

     "Holmes," said I, "you are not yourself. A sick man is but a child,
     and so I will treat you. Whether you like it or not, I will examine
     your symptoms and treat you for them."

     He looked at me with venomous eyes.

     "If I am to have a doctor whether I will or not, let me at least have
     someone in whom I have confidence," said he.

     "Then you have none in me?"

     "In your friendship, certainly. But facts are facts, Watson, and,
     after all, you are only a general practitioner with very limited
     experience and mediocre qualifications. It is painful to have to say
     these things, but you leave me no choice."

     I was bitterly hurt.

     "Such a remark is unworthy of you, Holmes. It shows me very clearly
     the state of your own nerves. But if you have no confidence in me I
     would not intrude my services. Let me bring Sir Jasper Meek or
     Penrose Fisher, or any of the best men in London. But someone you
     must have, and that is final. If you think that I am going to stand
     here and see you die without either helping you myself or bringing
     anyone else to help you, then you have mistaken your man."

     "You mean well, Watson," said the sick man with something between a
     sob and a groan. "Shall I demonstrate your own ignorance? What do you
     know, pray, of Tapanuli fever? What do you know of the black Formosa
     corruption?"

     "I have never heard of either."

     "There are many problems of disease, many strange pathological
     possibilities, in the East, Watson." He paused after each sentence to
     collect his failing strength. "I have learned so much during some
     recent researches which have a medico-criminal aspect. It was in the
     course of them that I contracted this complaint. You can do nothing."

     "Possibly not. But I happen to know that Dr. Ainstree, the greatest
     living authority upon tropical disease, is now in London. All
     remonstrance is useless, Holmes, I am going this instant to fetch
     him." I turned resolutely to the door.

     Never have I had such a shock! In an instant, with a tiger-spring,
     the dying man had intercepted me. I heard the sharp snap of a twisted
     key. The next moment he had staggered back to his bed, exhausted and
     panting after his one tremendous outflame of energy.

     "You won't take the key from be by force, Watson, I've got you, my
     friend. Here you are, and here you will stay until I will otherwise.
     But I'll humour you." (All this in little gasps, with terrible
     struggles for breath between.) "You've only my own good at heart. Of
     course I know that very well. You shall have your way, but give me
     time to get my strength. Not now, Watson, not now. It's four o'clock.
     At six you can go."

     "This is insanity, Holmes."

     "Only two hours, Watson. I promise you will go at six. Are you
     content to wait?"

     "I seem to have no choice."

     "None in the world, Watson. Thank you, I need no help in arranging
     the clothes. You will please keep your distance. Now, Watson, there
     is one other condition that I would make. You will seek help, not
     from the man you mention, but from the one that I choose."

     "By all means."

     "The first three sensible words that you have uttered since you
     entered this room, Watson. You will find some books over there. I am
     somewhat exhausted; I wonder how a battery feels when it pours
     electricity into a non-conductor? At six, Watson, we resume our
     conversation."

     But it was destined to be resumed long before that hour, and in
     circumstances which gave me a shock hardly second to that caused by
     his spring to the door. I had stood for some minutes looking at the
     silent figure in the bed. His face was almost covered by the clothes
     and he appeared to be asleep. Then, unable to settle down to reading,
     I walked slowly round the room, examining the pictures of celebrated
     criminals with which every wall was adorned. Finally, in my aimless
     perambulation, I came to the mantelpiece. A litter of pipes,
     tobacco-pouches, syringes, penknives, revolver-cartridges, and other
     debris was scattered over it. In the midst of these was a small black
     and white ivory box with a sliding lid. It was a neat little thing,
     and I had stretched out my hand to examine it more closely when--

     It was a dreadful cry that he gave--a yell which might have been
     heard down the street. My skin went cold and my hair bristled at that
     horrible scream. As I turned I caught a glimpse of a convulsed face
     and frantic eyes. I stood paralyzed, with the little box in my hand.

     "Put it down! Down, this instant, Watson--this instant, I say!" His
     head sank back upon the pillow and he gave a deep sigh of relief as I
     replaced the box upon the mantelpiece. "I hate to have my things
     touched, Watson. You know that I hate it. You fidget me beyond
     endurance. You, a doctor--you are enough to drive a patient into an
     asylum. Sit down, man, and let me have my rest!"

     The incident left a most unpleasant impression upon my mind. The
     violent and causeless excitement, followed by this brutality of
     speech, so far removed from his usual suavity, showed me how deep was
     the disorganization of his mind. Of all ruins, that of a noble mind
     is the most deplorable. I sat in silent dejection until the
     stipulated time had passed. He seemed to have been watching the clock
     as well as I, for it was hardly six before he began to talk with the
     same feverish animation as before.

     "Now, Watson," said he. "Have you any change in your pocket?"

     "Yes."

     "Any silver?"

     "A good deal."

     "How many half-crowns?"

     "I have five."

     "Ah, too few! Too few! How very unfortunate, Watson! However, such as
     they are you can put them in your watchpocket. And all the rest of
     your money in your left trouser pocket. Thank you. It will balance
     you so much better like that."

     This was raving insanity. He shuddered, and again made a sound
     between a cough and a sob.

     "You will now light the gas, Watson, but you will be very careful
     that not for one instant shall it be more than half on. I implore you
     to be careful, Watson. Thank you, that is excellent. No, you need not
     draw the blind. Now you will have the kindness to place some letters
     and papers upon this table within my reach. Thank you. Now some of
     that litter from the mantelpiece. Excellent, Watson! There is a
     sugar-tongs there. Kindly raise that small ivory box with its
     assistance.  Place it here among the papers. Good! You can now go and
     fetch Mr. Culverton Smith, of 13 Lower Burke Street."

     To tell the truth, my desire to fetch a doctor had somewhat weakened,
     for poor Holmes was so obviously delirious that it seemed dangerous
     to leave him. However, he was as eager now to consult the person
     named as he had been obstinate in refusing.

     "I never heard the name," said I.

     "Possibly not, my good Watson. It may surprise you to know that the
     man upon earth who is best versed in this disease is not a medical
     man, but a planter. Mr. Culverton Smith is a well-known resident of
     Sumatra, now visiting London. An outbreak of the disease upon his
     plantation, which was distant from medical aid, caused him to study
     it himself, with some rather far-reaching consequences. He is a very
     methodical person, and I did not desire you to start before six,
     because I was well aware that you would not find him in his study. If
     you could persuade him to come here and give us the benefit of his
     unique experience of this disease, the investigation of which has
     been his dearest hobby, I cannot doubt that he could help me."

     I gave Holmes's remarks as a consecutive whole and will not attempt
     to indicate how they were interrupted by gaspings for breath and
     those clutchings of his hands which indicated the pain from which he
     was suffering. His appearance had changed for the worse during the
     few hours that I had been with him. Those hectic spots were more
     pronounced, the eyes shone more brightly out of darker hollows, and a
     cold sweat glimmered upon his brow. He still retained, however, the
     jaunty gallantry of his speech. To the last gasp he would always be
     the master.

     "You will tell him exactly how you have left me," said he. "You will
     convey the very impression which is in your own mind--a dying man--a
     dying and delirious man. Indeed, I cannot think why the whole bed of
     the ocean is not one solid mass of oysters, so prolific the creatures
     seem. Ah, I am wondering! Strange how the brain controls the brain!
     What was I saying, Watson?"

     "My directions for Mr. Culverton Smith."

     "Ah, yes, I remember. My life depends upon it. Plead with him,
     Watson. There is no good feeling between us. His nephew, Watson--I
     had suspicions of foul play and I allowed him to see it. The boy died
     horribly. He has a grudge against me. You will soften him, Watson.
     Beg him, pray him, get him here by any means. He can save me--only
     he!"

     "I will bring him in a cab, if I have to carry him down to it."

     "You will do nothing of the sort. You will persuade him to come. And
     then you will return in front of him. Make any excuse so as not to
     come with him. Don't forget, Watson. You won't fail me. You never did
     fail me. No doubt there are natural enemies which limit the increase
     of the creatures. You and I, Watson, we have done our part. Shall the
     world, then, be overrun by oysters? No, no; horrible! You'll convey
     all that is in your mind."

     I left him full of the image of this magnificent intellect babbling
     like a foolish child. He had handed me the key, and with a happy
     thought I took it with me lest he should lock himself in. Mrs. Hudson
     was waiting, trembling and weeping, in the passage. Behind me as I
     passed from the flat I heard Holmes's high, thin voice in some
     delirious chant. Below, as I stood whistling for a cab, a man came on
     me through the fog.

     "How is Mr. Holmes, sir?" he asked.

     It was an old acquaintance, Inspector Morton, of Scotland Yard,
     dressed in unofficial tweeds.

     "He is very ill," I answered.

     He looked at me in a most singular fashion. Had it not been too
     fiendish, I could have imagined that the gleam of the fanlight showed
     exultation in his face.

     "I heard some rumour of it," said he.

     The cab had driven up, and I left him.

     Lower Burke Street proved to be a line of fine houses lying in the
     vague borderland between Notting Hill and Kensington. The particular
     one at which my cabman pulled up had an air of smug and demure
     respectability in its old-fashioned iron railings, its massive
     folding-door, and its shining brasswork. All was in keeping with a
     solemn butler who appeared framed in the pink radiance of a tinted
     electrical light behind him.

     "Yes, Mr. Culverton Smith is in. Dr. Watson! Very good, sir, I will
     take up your card."

     My humble name and title did not appear to impress Mr. Culverton
     Smith. Through the half-open door I heard a high, petulant,
     penetrating voice.

     "Who is this person? What does he want? Dear me, Staples, how often
     have I said that I am not to be disturbed in my hours of study?"

     There came a gentle flow of soothing explanation from the butler.

     "Well, I won't see him, Staples. I can't have my work interrupted
     like this. I am not at home. Say so. Tell him to come in the morning
     if he really must see me."

     Again the gentle murmur.

     "Well, well, give him that message. He can come in the morning, or he
     can stay away. My work must not be hindered."

     I thought of Holmes tossing upon his bed of sickness and counting the
     minutes, perhaps, until I could bring help to him. It was not a time
     to stand upon ceremony. His life depended upon my promptness. Before
     the apologetic butler had delivered his message I had pushed past him
     and was in the room.

     With a shrill cry of anger a man rose from a reclining chair beside
     the fire. I saw a great yellow face, coarse-grained and greasy, with
     heavy, double-chin, and two sullen, menacing gray eyes which glared
     at me from under tufted and sandy brows. A high bald head had a small
     velvet smoking-cap poised coquettishly upon one side of its pink
     curve. The skull was of enormous capacity, and yet as I looked down I
     saw to my amazement that the figure of the man was small and frail,
     twisted in the shoulders and back like one who has suffered from
     rickets in his childhood.

     "What's this?" he cried in a high, screaming voice. "What is the
     meaning of this intrusion? Didn't I send you word that I would see
     you to-morrow morning?"

     "I am sorry," said I, "but the matter cannot be delayed. Mr. Sherlock
     Holmes--"

     The mention of my friend's name had an extraordinary effect upon the
     little man. The look of anger passed in an instant from his face. His
     features became tense and alert.

     "Have you come from Holmes?" he asked.

     "I have just left him."

     "What about Holmes? How is he?"

     "He is desperately ill. That is why I have come."

     The man motioned me to a chair, and turned to resume his own. As he
     did so I caught a glimpse of his face in the mirror over the
     mantelpiece. I could have sworn that it was set in a malicious and
     abominable smile. Yet I persuaded myself that it must have been some
     nervous contraction which I had surprised, for he turned to me an
     instant later with genuine concern upon his features.

     "I am sorry to hear this," said he. "I only know Mr. Holmes through
     some business dealings which we have had, but I have every respect
     for his talents and his character. He is an amateur of crime, as I am
     of disease. For him the villain, for me the microbe. There are my
     prisons," he continued, pointing to a row of bottles and jars which
     stood upon a side table. "Among those gelatine cultivations some of
     the very worst offenders in the world are now doing time."

     "It was on account of your special knowledge that Mr. Holmes desired
     to see you. He has a high opinion of you and thought that you were
     the one man in London who could help him."

     The little man started, and the jaunty smoking-cap slid to the floor.

     "Why?" he asked. "Why should Mr. Homes think that I could help him in
     his trouble?"

     "Because of your knowledge of Eastern diseases."

     "But why should he think that this disease which he has contracted is
     Eastern?"

     "Because, in some professional inquiry, he has been working among
     Chinese sailors down in the docks."

     Mr. Culverton Smith smiled pleasantly and picked up his smoking-cap.

     "Oh, that's it--is it?" said he. "I trust the matter is not so grave
     as you suppose. How long has he been ill?"

     "About three days."

     "Is he delirious?"

     "Occasionally."

     "Tut, tut! This sounds serious. It would be inhuman not to answer his
     call. I very much resent any interruption to my work, Dr. Watson, but
     this case is certainly exceptional. I will come with you at once."

     I remembered Holmes's injunction.

     "I have another appointment," said I.

     "Very good. I will go alone. I have a note of Mr. Holmes's address.
     You can rely upon my being there within half an hour at most."

     It was with a sinking heart that I reentered Holmes's bedroom. For
     all that I knew the worst might have happened in my absence. To my
     enormous relief, he had improved greatly in the interval. His
     appearance was as ghastly as ever, but all trace of delirium had left
     him and he spoke in a feeble voice, it is true, but with even more
     than his usual crispness and lucidity.

     "Well, did you see him, Watson?"

     "Yes; he is coming."

     "Admirable, Watson! Admirable! You are the best of messengers."

     "He wished to return with me."

     "That would never do, Watson. That would be obviously impossible. Did
     he ask what ailed me?"

     "I told him about the Chinese in the East End."

     "Exactly! Well, Watson, you have done all that a good friend could.
     You can now disappear from the scene."

     "I must wait and hear his opinion, Holmes."

     "Of course you must. But I have reasons to suppose that this opinion
     would be very much more frank and valuable if he imagines that we are
     alone. There is just room behind the head of my bed, Watson."

     "My dear Holmes!"

     "I fear there is no alternative, Watson. The room does not lend
     itself to concealment, which is as well, as it is the less likely to
     arouse suspicion. But just there, Watson, I fancy that it could be
     done." Suddenly he sat up with a rigid intentness upon his haggard
     face. "There are the wheels, Watson. Quick, man, if you love me! And
     don't budge, whatever happens--whatever happens, do you hear? Don't
     speak! Don't move! Just listen with all your ears." Then in an
     instant his sudden access of strength departed, and his masterful,
     purposeful talk droned away into the low, vague murmurings of a
     semi-delirious man.

     From the hiding-place into which I had been so swiftly hustled I
     heard the footfalls upon the stair, with the opening and the closing
     of the bedroom door. Then, to my surprise, there came a long silence,
     broken only by the heavy breathings and gaspings of the sick man. I
     could imagine that our visitor was standing by the bedside and
     looking down at the sufferer. At last that strange hush was broken.

     "Holmes!" he cried. "Holmes!" in the insistent tone of one who
     awakens a sleeper. "Can't you hear me, Holmes?" There was a rustling,
     as if he had shaken the sick man roughly by the shoulder.

     "Is that you, Mr. Smith?" Holmes whispered. "I hardly dared hope that
     you would come."

     The other laughed.

     "I should imagine not," he said. "And yet, you see, I am here. Coals
     of fire, Holmes--coals of fire!"

     "It is very good of you--very noble of you. I appreciate your special
     knowledge."

     Our visitor sniggered.

     "You do.  You are, fortunately, the only man in London who does. Do
     you know what is the matter with you?"

     "The same," said Holmes.

     "Ah! You recognize the symptoms?"

     "Only too well."

     "Well, I shouldn't be surprised, Holmes. I shouldn't be surprised if
     it were the same. A bad lookout for you if it is. Poor Victor was a
     dead man on the fourth day--a strong, hearty young fellow. It was
     certainly, as you said, very surprising that he should have
     contracted and out-of-the-way Asiatic disease in the heart of
     London--a disease, too, of which I had made such a very special
     study. Singular coincidence, Holmes. Very smart of you to notice it,
     but rather uncharitable to suggest that it was cause and effect."

     "I knew that you did it."

     "Oh, you did, did you? Well, you couldn't prove it, anyhow. But what
     do you think of yourself spreading reports about me like that, and
     then crawling to me for help the moment you are in trouble? What sort
     of a game is that--eh?"

     I heard the rasping, laboured breathing of the sick man. "Give me the
     water!" he gasped.

     "You're precious near your end, my friend, but I don't want you to go
     till I have had a word with you. That's why I give you water. There,
     don't slop it about! That's right. Can you understand what I say?"

     Holmes groaned.

     "Do what you can for me. Let bygones be bygones," he whispered. "I'll
     put the words out of my head--I swear I will. Only cure me, and I'll
     forget it."

     "Forget what?"

     "Well, about Victor Savage's death. You as good as admitted just now
     that you had done it. I'll forget it."

     "You can forget it or remember it, just as you like. I don't see you
     in the witnessbox. Quite another shaped box, my good Holmes, I assure
     you. It matters nothing to me that you should know how my nephew
     died. It's not him we are talking about. It's you."

     "Yes, yes."

     "The fellow who came for me--I've forgotten his name--said that you
     contracted it down in the East End among the sailors."

     "I could only account for it so."

     "You are proud of your brains, Holmes, are you not? Think yourself
     smart, don't you? You came across someone who was smarter this time.
     Now cast your mind back, Holmes. Can you think of no other way you
     could have got this thing?"

     "I can't think. My mind is gone. For heaven's sake help me!"

     "Yes, I will help you. I'll help you to understand just where you are
     and how you got there. I'd like you to know before you die."

     "Give me something to ease my pain."

     "Painful, is it? Yes, the coolies used to do some squealing towards
     the end. Takes you as cramp, I fancy."

     "Yes, yes; it is cramp."

     "Well, you can hear what I say, anyhow. Listen now! Can you remember
     any unusual incident in your life just about the time your symptoms
     began?"

     "No, no; nothing."

     "Think again."

     "I'm too ill to think."

     "Well, then, I'll help you.  Did anything come by post?"

     "By post?"

     "A box by chance?"

     "I'm fainting--I'm gone!"

     "Listen, Holmes!" There was a sound as if he was shaking the dying
     man, and it was all that I could do to hold myself quiet in my
     hiding-place. "You must hear me. You shall hear me. Do you remember a
     box--an ivory box? It came on Wednesday. You opened it--do you
     remember?"

     "Yes, yes, I opened it. There was a sharp spring inside it. Some
     joke--"

     "It was no joke, as you will find to your cost. You fool, you would
     have it and you have got it. Who asked you to cross my path? If you
     had left me alone I would not have hurt you."

     "I remember," Holmes gasped. "The spring! It drew blood. This
     box--this on the table."

     "The very one, by George! And it may as well leave the room in my
     pocket. There goes your last shred of evidence. But you have the
     truth now, Holmes, and you can die with the knowledge that I killed
     you. You knew too much of the fate of Victor Savage, so I have sent
     you to share it. You are very near your end, Holmes. I will sit here
     and I will watch you die."

     Holmes's voice had sunk to an almost inaudible whisper.

     "What is that?" said Smith. "Turn up the gas? Ah, the shadows begin
     to fall, do they? Yes, I will turn it up, that I may see you the
     better." He crossed the room and the light suddenly brightened. "Is
     there any other little service that I can do you, my friend?"

     "A match and a cigarette."

     I nearly called out in my joy and my amazement. He was speaking in
     his natural voice--a little weak, perhaps, but the very voice I knew.
     There was a long pause, and I felt that Culverton Smith was standing
     in silent amazement looking down at his companion.

     "What's the meaning of this?" I heard him say at last in a dry,
     rasping tone.

     "The best way of successfully acting a part is to be it," said
     Holmes. "I give you my word that for three days I have tasted neither
     food nor drink until you were good enough to pour me out that glass
     of water. But it is the tobacco which I find most irksome. Ah, here
     are some cigarettes." I heard the striking of a match. "That is very
     much better. Halloa! halloa! Do I hear the step of a friend?"

     There were footfalls outside, the door opened, and Inspector Morton
     appeared.

     "All is in order and this is your man," said Holmes.

     The officer gave the usual cautions.

     "I arrest you on the charge of the murder of one Victor Savage," he
     concluded.

     "And you might add of the attempted murder of one Sherlock Holmes,"
     remarked my friend with a chuckle. "To save an invalid trouble,
     Inspector, Mr. Culverton Smith was good enough to give our signal by
     turning up the gas. By the way, the prisoner has a small box in the
     right-hand pocket of his coat which it would be as well to remove.
     Thank you. I would handle it gingerly if I were you. Put it down
     here. It may play its part in the trial."

     There was a sudden rush and a scuffle, followed by the clash of iron
     and a cry of pain.

     "You'll only get yourself hurt," said the inspector. "Stand still,
     will you?" There was the click of the closing handcuffs.

     "A nice trap!" cried the high, snarling voice. "It will bring you
     into the dock, Holmes, not me. He asked me to come here to cure him.
     I was sorry for him and I came. Now he will pretend, no doubt, that I
     have said anything which he may invent which will corroborate his
     insane suspicions. You can lie as you like, Holmes.  My word is
     always as good as yours."

     "Good heavens!" cried Holmes. "I had totally forgotten him. My dear
     Watson, I owe you a thousand apologies. To think that I should have
     overlooked you! I need not introduce you to Mr. Culverton Smith,
     since I understand that you met somewhat earlier in the evening. Have
     you the cab below? I will follow you when I am dressed, for I may be
     of some use at the station.

     "I never needed it more," said Holmes as he refreshed himself with a
     glass of claret and some biscuits in the intervals of his toilet.
     "However, as you know, my habits are irregular, and such a feat means
     less to me than to most men. It was very essential that I should
     impress Mrs. Hudson with the reality of my condition, since she was
     to convey it to you, and you in turn to him. You won't be offended,
     Watson? You will realize that among your many talents dissimulation
     finds no place, and that if you had shared my secret you would never
     have been able to impress Smith with the urgent necessity of his
     presence, which was the vital point of the whole scheme. Knowing his
     vindictive nature, I was perfectly certain that he would come to look
     upon his handiwork."

     "But your appearance, Holmes--your ghastly face?"

     "Three days of absolute fast does not improve one's beauty, Watson.
     For the rest, there is nothing which a sponge may not cure. With
     vaseline upon one's forehead, belladonna in one's eyes, rouge over
     the cheek-bones, and crusts of beeswax round one's lips, a very
     satisfying effect can be produced. Malingering is a subject upon
     which I have sometimes thought of writing a monograph. A little
     occasional talk about half-crowns, oysters, or any other extraneous
     subject produces a pleasing effect of delirium."

     "But why would you not let me near you, since there was in truth no
     infection?"

     "Can you ask, my dear Watson? Do you imagine that I have no respect
     for your medical talents? Could I fancy that your astute judgment
     would pass a dying man who, however weak, had no rise of pulse or
     temperature? At four yards, I could deceive you. If I failed to do
     so, who would bring my Smith within my grasp? No, Watson, I would not
     touch that box. You can just see if you look at it sideways where the
     sharp spring like a viper's tooth emerges as you open it. I dare say
     it was by some such device that poor Savage, who stood between this
     monster and a reversion, was done to death. My correspondence,
     however, is, as you know, a varied one, and I am somewhat upon my
     guard against any packages which reach me. It was clear to me,
     however, that by pretending that he had really succeeded in his
     design I might surprise a confession. That pretence I have carried
     out with the thoroughness of the true artist. Thank you, Watson, you
     must help me on with my coat. When we have finished at the
     police-station I think that something nutritious at Simpson's would
     not be out of place."
